          Hey! We are Matthew, Eyosyas, Ali & Shadab and we are first year computer science students. Our app is called Flow.
          We built the ultimate student go-to app. <br>
          Flow helps students keep track of assignment and homework deadlines and makes students aware of up and coming quizzes and tests.
          Flow also lets students calculate how much they'd need in the next assessments to reach their target goal.
          It uses real-time data from course websites and updates automatically and organizes all the necessary information about the courses
          they are taking. Flow helps create a sense of urgency for the student by showing them when they next due date is and inspires them to organize their
          valuable time more effectively.

        <p class = "about"> Check out our real-time cloud based solution for helping students get through university. <br> The application has capability to be implemented on any school, university or work place database. The App was designed initially to be used with eClass API for York University. The cloud based solution is not prone to as many failures as the current eClass system whilst staying robust. Combined with a beautiful UI that uses modern frameworks like Flutter, you could say Flow is a no brainer. </p>
